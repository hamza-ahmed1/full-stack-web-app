# Web App Developed by Hamza A.K

This web app is developed by **Hamza A.K**, designed and built from scratch with the latest technologies like **Prisma** for database management and **PostgreSQL** as the relational database.

## How to Set Up the Project

### Step 1: Set Up Prisma
1. Go to the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs) and choose the **Start from Scratch** guide to set up your Prisma environment.
2. Copy the Prisma schema from your newly created project and paste it into the `schema.prisma` file of your project.

### Step 2: Set Up PostgreSQL with Docker
1. Run a Docker image for PostgreSQL and set the following environment variables:
   - `POSTGRES_USER`: `hamza`
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: `hamza1234`
   - `POSTGRES_DB`: `school`

### Step 3: Run Migrations
1. After setting up Prisma and the database, run the following migration command to apply your Prisma schema to the database:

   npx prisma migrate dev
### Step 4: Launch Prisma Studio
To view and manage your database directly, launch Prisma Studio:
npx prisma studio
This will open Prisma Studio on localhost:5555, where you can view and manage your database records.
### Step 5: Add Seed Data
Create a seed.ts file to populate the database with some initial data. Hereâ€™s an example of a seed file:

import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Hamza A.K',
      email: 'hamza@example.com',
    },
  });
}

main()
  .catch(e => {
    throw e;
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
This will add a user with the name Hamza A.K and email hamza@example.com.
### Step 6: Set Up Prisma Client
In the lib directory, create a prisma.ts file with the following content:

import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

export const prisma = new PrismaClient();
### Step 7: Modify package.json for Prisma Seed
Add the following configuration in the package.json file under the "prisma" section to enable seeding of the database with the Prisma CLI:

"prisma": {
  "seed": "ts-node --compiler-options {\"module\":\"CommonJS\"} prisma/seed.ts"
}
### Step 8: Install Dependencies
Install the necessary development dependencies, including ts-node for running TypeScript files:

npm install --save-dev ts-node
### Step 9: Seed the Database
Finally, seed the database by running the following command:

npx prisma db seed

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Each step is clearly numbered with a short description followed by the code snippets required for that step.
2. **Prisma Studio** launch step (Step 4) is now clearly explained with the command `npx prisma studio` and a note that the database can be managed at [localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555).
3. **Seed Data**: A sample `seed.ts` file is included under **Step 5**.
4. **Prisma Client Setup**: Step 6 describes how to set up Prisma Client with the required `prisma.ts` file.
5. **Final Steps**: The remaining steps guide you on modifying `package.json`, installing dependencies, and seeding the database.
